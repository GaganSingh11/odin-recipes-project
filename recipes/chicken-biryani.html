    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        Although widely associated with Indian cuisine, Chicken Biryani is a dish that has spread across a wide swath of
        South Asia, reaching as far west as Iraq and as far east as Indonesia. The vast geographical area Biryani calls
        home has resulted in a wide variety of preparations and ingredients; however, it is typically prepared by
        layering seasoned chicken with rice and aromatics and steaming them together.

        <li>saffron</li>

    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>To marinate the chicken for the biryani, combine the vegetable oil, garlic, ginger, chili peppers, mint,
            cilantro, garam masala, cinnamon and salt in a large bowl and stir together. Add the chicken pieces and toss
            together making sure the chicken is thoroughly coated in the marinade. Allow the chicken to marinate for at
            least 1 hour or up to overnight.</li>
        <li>In a pot wide enough to hold the chicken in a single layer, add the ghee and onions and saute the onions
            until they are well caramelized (15-20 minutes). Transfer the caramelized onions to a bowl and set aside.
        </li>
        <li>While the onions caramelize, prepare the rice by washing in a strainer under cold running water until the
            water runs clear.</li>
        <li>To par-boil the rice, add the water, salt, cardamom, cumin and bay leaf to a pot and bring to a boil. Add
            the rice and boil for 7 minutes. Drain the rice, reserving 1 cup of the liquid.</li>
        <li>
            In the pot you caramelized the onions in, add the chicken in a single layer, skin-side down. Fry until
            golden brown on one side (about 5 minutes). Flip the chicken over and fry the other side until golden brown.
            Transfer the chicken back to the bowl you marinated it in.
        </li>
        <li>
            To assemble the biryani, add the saffron to the rice and toss to distribute evenly. Add half the rice
            mixture to the bottom of the pot you browned the chicken in.
        </li>
        <li>
            Finish putting together the Biryani by adding the rest of the rice in an even layer. Add 1 cup of reserved
            liquid from boiling the rice. Cover the pot with a lid and put the pot on the stove over medium heat and set
            the timer for 20 minutes. When you can see steam escaping from under the lid, turn down the heat to low and
            continue cooking until the timer goes off and then turn off the heat.
        </li>
        <li>
            Mix the Chicken Biryani together and then transfer to a serving platter. Garnish with fresh cilantro and serve.
        </li>

    </ol>
